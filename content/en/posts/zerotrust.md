## Zero Trust

is a security model that assumes that all users, devices, and applications are untrusted and must be verified before being granted access to resources. This approach is based on the principle of "never trust, always verify" and is designed to protect against cyber threats such as data breaches, malware, and phishing attacks. The Zero Trust model requires strict identity verification, access control, and continuous monitoring of all network traffic to ensure that only authorized users and devices can access sensitive data<sup>1 3</sup>.


The main benefits of Zero Trust include reducing the attack surface and risk of a data breach, providing granular access control over cloud and container environments, and mitigating the impact and severity of successful attacks, reducing cleanup time and cost<sup>1</sup>. By implementing a Zero Trust model, organizations can better secure their networks and protect their sensitive data from cyber threats.


In summary, Zero Trust is a security model that provides a comprehensive approach to securing networks and data. By assuming that all users, devices, and applications are untrusted and requiring strict identity verification and access control, organizations can reduce the risk of cyber threats such as data breaches. The main benefits of Zero Trust include reducing the attack surface, providing granular access control, and mitigating the impact of successful attacks<sup>1 2 4</sup>.
